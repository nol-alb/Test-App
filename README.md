#  Websocket Project

This test project is confidential.

## Time frame

For this take-home test project, you are given roughly 36 hours to complete what you can. There is no set submission time. 

If you'd like extra time to complete, please contact your technical interviewer(s).

If you are working full-time and would like to do this at night instead of on a day off, please coordinate with your technical interviewer(s).

## Requirements

These requirements are listed by importance.

### Project
0. Create web socket setup that pipe audio from the `test_audio.mp3` file to through a socket set up within the `socket.js` file. 
1. Playback audio/PCM via socket to audiobuffer (Sa from a AudioContext) 


### Notes

### 1. Write code and comments that most junior-mid level developers can understand

Err on the side of clarity over brevity. 

This will make it easier for everyone to understand and will help more easily onboard new developers or seasoned polyglots picking up a new language.

Use standard naming conventions.

Be concise with your function and object names. 

Write inline comments to simply explain what your code does. 

It is easier to write even a poorly written comment than to revisit your code months later having forgotten what it was supposed to do. 

### 2. Document your code

Make inline comments that anyone can understand.

Key functions, extensions, classes, enums, etc. should be annotated with concise quick help information. 


## Notes from candidate

Put notes on what you implemented, any issues you had, what else you would do if you had more time, etc.
